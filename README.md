This is a project I created to learn more about low-level programming and delve into the world of compilers. The goal is to create a simple programming language that compiles to LLVM IR.

You may look at the code and think the means to my desired end are incorrect and/or inefficient. That's not a bug, but a feature, as they say in San Francisco. I'm doing this to learn and mess around, so I won't hesitate to break stuff if it means I'll learn something new.

# Example

```go
func main () {
    check_typed();
}

func check_if_typed_apple(reading: string) {
    variable := "apple";
    if reading == variable {
        println("You typed 'apple'");
    } else {
        println("You didn't type 'apple'.");
        check_typed();
    }
}

func check_typed() {
    println("");
    println("Type something: ");

    reading := readln();
    println("You typed $reading");
    
    check_if_typed_apple(reading);
}
```
